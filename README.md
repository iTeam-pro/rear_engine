# RearEngine - CakePHP 3 plugin

RearEngine is designed and developed to use the power and flexibility of CakePHP
for creation applications with a minimum amount of time.

**Warning! It is early development stage. Do not use in real projects. The
production version will be released after the official release CakePHP**

## Installing RearEngine via composer

You can install RearEngine into your project using
[composer](http://getcomposer.org).  If you're starting a new project, we
recommend using the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app) after 
commit cakephp/app@4b20305260afa81b9792ad3fba2c737ab00c3860 as
a starting point. For existing applications you can add the following to your
`composer.json` file:

	"require": {
		"composer/installers": "dev-master",
		"iteam-pro/rear_engine": "dev-master"
	}
